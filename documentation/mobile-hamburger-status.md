# Mobile Hamburger Overlay - Current Status

## Implementation Status - COMPLETED ✅

All issues with the mobile hamburger overlay have been successfully resolved:

1. **✅ Padding Reduction**: Changed `py-8` to `py-4` to reduce vertical spacing
2. **✅ Background Opacity**: Updated from `bg-background/90` to solid colors `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`
3. **✅ Text Visibility**: Changed from theme-dependent `text-foreground` to explicit `text-black dark:text-white`
4. **✅ Theme Toggle Visibility**: Updated styling for better contrast
5. **✅ Secondary Close Button**: **DELETED** - Physically removed default close button from SheetContent component
6. **✅ Contact Block Positioning**: Lifted contact block to safe air-space with proper spacing
7. **✅ Desktop Navigation Leak**: Fixed breakpoint from `md:` to `lg:` to prevent desktop nav on tablets
8. **✅ Wishlist Heart Colors**: Locked colors to indestructible values that never flip with themes

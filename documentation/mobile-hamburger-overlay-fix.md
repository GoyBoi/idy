# Mobile Hamburger Overlay - Current State Documentation

## Issues Previously Identified and Fixed

1. **Transparency Problem**: The mobile hamburger overlay was using `bg-background` which caused it to be partially transparent, showing content behind it
2. **Theme Toggle Visibility**: The theme toggle icon wasn't clearly visible in all theme modes
3. **Text Visibility**: Text inside the overlay would disappear when theme was toggled due to color conflicts
4. **Visual Distraction**: The glassmorphism effect was making the overlay visually distracting
5. **Secondary Close Button**: SheetContent component was automatically adding a default close button
6. **Contact Block Positioning**: Contact buttons were too close to bottom of viewport
7. **Desktop Navigation Leak**: Desktop navigation showing on tablet-sized screens
8. **Wishlist Heart Colors**: Wishlist counter background changing with theme

## Solutions Implemented and Verified

### 1. Fixed Background Transparency
- **Solution**: Updated SheetContent to use solid colors `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900` instead of theme-dependent backgrounds
- **Result**: Overlay now has consistent solid background that doesn't show content behind it

### 2. Improved Theme Toggle Visibility
- **Solution**: Updated theme toggle to use specific gray shades `bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700` that work well in both light and dark modes
- **Result**: Theme toggle icon is clearly visible in all theme modes

### 3. Ensured Text Visibility
- **Solution**: Changed text colors from `text-foreground` to explicit `text-black dark:text-white`
- **Result**: Text remains visible regardless of theme changes

### 4. Removed Problematic Styles
- **Solution**: Removed `drop-shadow` and `backdrop-blur` effects that were causing visual conflicts
- **Result**: Cleaner, distraction-free user experience

### 5. Deleted Ghost Secondary Close Button
- **Solution**: Physically removed default close button from SheetContent component in `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`
- **Result**: Only one close button now exists (our explicit one in the SheetHeader)

### 6. Lifted Contact Block to Safe Air-Space
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced navigation links max-height from `max-h-[60vh]` to `max-h-[50vh]`
  - Reduced top margin of contact buttons from `mt-1` to `mt-0`
- **Result**: Contact block now sits ≥ 24 px below close icon and ≥ 24 px above viewport bottom

### 7. Killed Landscape Desktop-Leak
- **Solution**: Changed breakpoints from `md:` to `lg:` for proper mobile/tablet separation
- **Result**: Desktop navigation properly hidden on tablet-sized screens

### 8. Locked Wishlist Heart Colors
- **Solution**: Changed wishlist counter background to fixed `bg-yellow-400`
- **Result**: Wishlist hearts maintain consistent colors that never flip with themes

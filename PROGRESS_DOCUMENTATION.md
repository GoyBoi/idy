## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Tailwind CSS Purging Issue
**Problem**: Button styling classes were being purged by Tailwind's optimization, causing DeleteButton to appear as plain text.

**Solution**: 
- Added safelist configuration to tailwind.config.js to preserve critical button classes
- Ensured all shadcn/ui button variants and sizes are included in the safelist
- Verified that CSS variables are properly defined for theme colors

**Learning**: Tailwind's purge functionality requires explicit configuration to preserve dynamic classes. Using safelist is essential when working with component libraries that generate classes dynamically.

### 2. Component Directory Confusion
**Problem**: Duplicate component directories (`/components/` and `/src/components/`) caused import confusion and maintenance issues.

**Solution**:
- Consolidated all components into a single `/src/components/` directory
- Removed the redundant `/components/` directory
- Updated all import paths to use consistent `@/components/` aliases

**Learning**: Maintaining a single source of truth for components reduces confusion and improves maintainability.

### 3. CSS Import Issues
**Problem**: Custom CSS files were not being properly imported, leading to missing styles.

**Solution**:
- Updated webpack configuration to properly handle CSS imports
- Ensured Tailwind CSS output is correctly generated and referenced
- Added proper CSS file references in HTML templates

**Learning**: Proper webpack configuration is crucial for CSS processing and bundling.

### 4. DeleteButton Implementation
**Problem**: Initial DeleteButton implementation was not properly styled and caused confusion with multiple versions.

**Solution**:
- Removed custom DeleteButton implementations
- Standardized on using shadcn/ui Button component directly
- Ensured proper import paths and usage throughout the application
- Verified styling through visual testing

**Learning**: Leveraging established component libraries like shadcn/ui reduces implementation complexity and ensures consistency.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Component Library Integration
- Using shadcn/ui components provides consistent, accessible UI elements
- Proper configuration of Tailwind with component libraries requires attention to purging settings
- Component composition is often better than creating custom wrappers
- Extending component libraries with custom variants enhances design capabilities

### 2. Styling Best Practices
- Tailwind's utility-first approach works well with component libraries
- CSS variables provide excellent theming capabilities
- Safelisting critical classes prevents styling issues in production
- Gradient backgrounds and animations enhance visual appeal

### 3. Project Structure
- Consistent directory structure improves maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between UI components and application logic
- Proper alias configuration simplifies imports
- Component documentation aids collaboration and future maintenance

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Visual testing is crucial for UI components
- End-to-end testing with Playwright validates user interactions
- Unit testing with Jest/React Testing Library ensures component functionality

### 5. Development Workflow
- Incremental development with frequent testing prevents major issues
- Cleaning up unnecessary code and files improves project clarity
- Documentation of problems and solutions aids future development
